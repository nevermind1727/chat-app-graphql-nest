# Realtime Chat Application
![Conversation example](https://i.imgur.com/iV80PDB.png)

This is the Realtime Chat Application project that I have built from the
ground up. It is used for realtime communication between people where
you can create conversations with many of different users. In the future I will implement more featuers like audio messages, video calls etc.

Technologies used in the project:
<br>
Frontend:
  * Next.js
  * Chakra UI 
  * GraphQL Apollo Client.

Backend:
  + Nest.js
  + MySQL
  + Prisma
  + GraphQL
  + Websockets

For authentication i used next/auth package with OAuth 2.0 Google Authorization. 
In order to complete realtime interaction i used GraphQL Subscriptions with graphql-ws package.
